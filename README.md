# Spotify-nd

**Spotify-nd** is used to display the amount of times you listened to a track based on your streaming history JSON files that can be requested from "Download your data" section within the [privacy settings](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/) of your account.

This is useful for some users since **Spotify** do not include a count of specific tracks you have listened to within their **Spotify Wrapped** event.

## Sample Run

User can input a track name and the path to the streaming history files, in this case 'The Eraser' is used:
